Introduction
This project is aimed to provide a user panel to access FREE, SECURE and PRIVATE VLESS, Trojan and Warp configs, It ensures connectivity even when domains or Warp services are blocked by ISPs, offering two deployment options:

Workers deployment
Pages deployment

Features
Free and Private: No costs involved and the server is private.
Intuitive Panel: Streamlined for effortless navigation, configuration and use.
Versatile Protocols: Provides VLESS, Trojan and Wireguard (Warp) protocols.
Warp Pro configs: Optimized Warp for crucial circumstances.
Fragment support: Supports Fragment functionality for crucial network situations.
Comprehensive Routing Rules: Bypassing Iran/China/Russia and LAN, Blocking QUIC, Porn, Ads, Malwares, Phishing and more.

Password-protected panel: Provides secure and private panel with password protection.
Fully customizable: Supports setting up clean IP-domains, Proxy IPs, DNS servers, choosing ports and protocols, Warp endpoints and more.
Limitations
UDP transport: VLESS and Trojan protocols on workers do not handle UDP properly, so it is disabled by default (affecting features like Telegram video calls), UDP DNS is also unsupported. DoH is enabled by default for enhanced security.
Request limit: each worker supports 100K requests per day for VLESS and Trojan, suitable for 2-3 users. You can use custom personal domains to bypass limitation on VLESS/Trojan (Workers deployment) or opt for limitless Warp configurations.
